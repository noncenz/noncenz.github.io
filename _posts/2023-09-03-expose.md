Some boxes aim to emulate an actual penetration test experience while others are more game-oriented. This box falls into the latter category, but serves as a great training experience for several real-world techniques. If you came here because you‚Äôre stuck looking for a foothold, read the two brute-force sections and then go back and try harder. The box flows much more consistently once you know where to begin! Thanks to [1337rce](https://tryhackme.com/p/1337rce) and the folks over at TryHackMe for this box.

## üîç Enumeration

Our first pass with nmap doesn‚Äôt leave us much to work with‚Ä¶.

{: .nolineno }

We run a more thorough scan to find our target website on 1337 and our ‚Äúinteresting service‚Äù as pronmised in the box‚Äôs introduction. 

```bash
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ(noncenz„âøkali)-[~]

### üêá¬†Enumerate mqtt

There are a number of scripts floating around to enumerate mqtt, but the most straightforward path I found was to use mosquitto-clients.

`sudo apt install mosquitto-clients`

We subscribe to all topics with `mosquitto_sub -t '#' -v -h 10.10.xx.xx` 

We can also get system statistics with `mosquitto_sub -t '$SYS/#' -v -h 10.10.xx.xx`

After letting this run in the background for a wile as we interact with the rest of the site, we come to the conclusion that there is no traffic here. We can use `mosquitto_pub` to send arbitrary messages that have no effect except to be received back in our subscriber. 

### üêá¬†Enumerate DNS

Various attempts with `dig` and `nslookup` fail to return any records from DNS.

### üï∏Ô∏è Enumerate web app on port 1337

```bash
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ(noncenz„âøkali)-[~]
‚îî‚îÄ$ curl 10.10.xx.xx:1337                                                                                                                                  
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
        <title>EXPOSED</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>EXPOSED</h1>
```
{: .nolineno }

### Initial Directory Brute-Force
We run our normal scan with ZAP or gobuster in search of a start page for the application.
#### üêá¬†Admin page #1:

Our initial brute-force leads us to an admin page that provides a not-so-subtle hint that it might be a rabbit-hole. 

![Screenshot 2023-09-03 at 9.36.05 AM.png](/assets/expose/Screenshot_2023-09-03_at_9.36.05_AM.png)

Indeed, we note that the form submission for this page isn‚Äôt even wired up. To be sure, we extract the parameters for the form and submit them manually with both GET and POST requests. We find the page unresponsive to our calls, and consider it to be a rabbit-hole. We‚Äôre going to need a different entrypoint. 

### Directory Brute-Force Revisited

There are three things we can try to improve our success with a directory brute-force:

1. **Scan for filenames:** This is a PHP site so we‚Äôll include the extension `.php` in our scan, as well as `.zip`, `.tar`, `.txt` and anything else that seems appropriate. 
2. **Use a host name or subdomain:** We may be missing entire sites if the webserver is set up for virtual hosts. In a CTF we would expect:
    1. To be told in the instructions to set up a host name in `/etc/hosts` (this may not be the ONLY host name, but on THM it‚Äôs an indication that virtual hosts may be in play.)
    2. To have a host name leaked somewhere on the site via a URL, in an SSL cert etc. 
    3. To dump hosts from DNS hosted on the box. 
    
    Only option c applies to us, and DNS enumeration did not return any data, so we move on. 
    
3. **Try a new wordlist:** I‚Äôve been using either `directory-list-1.0` or `directory-list-2.3-medium` out of habit. On this box I added  `raft-small-directories` which provided an additional directory `admin_101`. Using that list was pretty much the key to this box. 

## ü¶∂üèª Foothold

Our new admin panel looks much more promising, as it gifts us with a username and actually posts data back to the server. 

![Screenshot 2023-09-03 at 10.12.22 AM.png](/assets/expose/Screenshot_2023-09-03_at_10.12.22_AM.png)

Scanning this page with ZAP we find that it‚Äôs got a SQL injection flaw. We‚Äôll save the POST message for this page from ZAP into the file `sqli.raw` and run SQLMap to see if we can dump the database

![Screenshot 2023-09-03 at 10.28.48 AM.png](/assets/expose/Screenshot_2023-09-03_at_10.28.48_AM.png)

>If you‚Äôre using ZAP to scan for SQLi, make sure you‚Äôve submitted at least one login attempt through the form before starting the scan. ZAP needs to see the POST request in history to know to fuzz it!
{: .prompt-tip }


### Dump the Database

We'll dump the database with SQLMap.

`sqlmap -r sqli.raw --dump --threads=10`

```bash
Table: config
[2 entries]
+----+------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| id | url                          | password                                            |
+----+------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| 1  | /file1010111/index.php       | 69[redacted]29                                      |

```
{: .nolineno }

We can use [crackstation.net](http://crackstation.net), [hashmob.net](http://hashmob.net) etc to look up the MD5 hash for the first URL. 

![Screenshot 2023-09-03 at 10.47.49 AM.png](/assets/expose/Screenshot_2023-09-03_at_10.47.49_AM.png)

### Perform LFI

Visiting the page at `/file1010111/index.php` and providing our newly found password, we‚Äôre given a hint about fuzzing and a second hint that there may be more content on the page. 

![Screenshot 2023-09-03 at 10.56.01 AM.png](/assets/expose/Screenshot_2023-09-03_at_10.56.01_AM.png)

We‚Äôll view-source and sure enough, there is a hidden span on the page with some pretty specific advice‚Ä¶.

![Screenshot 2023-09-03 at 10.56.53 AM.png](/assets/expose/Screenshot_2023-09-03_at_10.56.53_AM.png)

We can enumerate this manually by appending the parameter `file=` to the end of our url. The classic test in this case is to ask for `/etc/passwd` either directly or indirectly at `../../../../etc/passwd`

In this case, we find success with:

`POST http://10.10.xx.xx:1337/file1010111/index.php?file=/etc/passwd HTTP/1.1`


![Screenshot 2023-09-03 at 11.03.35 AM.png](/assets/expose/Screenshot_2023-09-03_at_11.03.35_AM.png)

Use view-source to make it more readable‚Ä¶.

![Screenshot 2023-09-03 at 11.04.08 AM.png](/assets/expose/Screenshot_2023-09-03_at_11.04.08_AM.png)

### Upload a Reverse Shell

We move on to our next endpoint at `/upload-cv00101011/index.php`

![Screenshot 2023-09-03 at 11.12.43 AM.png](/assets/expose/Screenshot_2023-09-03_at_11.12.43_AM.png)

Conveniently, we already have the box‚Äôs user list from the previous page. We enter the appropriate user name here to move on to the file upload page. 

#### Modify client-side javascript.

We're presented with a file upload page. 
![Screenshot 2023-09-03 at 12.16.35 PM.png](/assets/expose/Screenshot_2023-09-03_at_12.16.35_PM.png)


We select and try to upload a PHP reverse shell, but the upload button is disabled. Examining the source for this page we see some client-side validation limiting the extensions of files uploaded:

```jsx
function validate(){

 var fileInput = document.getElementById('file');
  var file = fileInput.files[0];
  
  if (file) {
    var fileName = file.name;
    var fileExtension = fileName.split('.').pop().toLowerCase();
    
    if (fileExtension === 'jpg' || fileExtension === 'png') {
      // Valid file extension, proceed with file upload
      // You can submit the form or perform further processing here
      console.log('File uploaded successfully');
	  return true;
    } else {
      // Invalid file extension, display an error message or take appropriate action
      console.log('Only JPG and PNG files are allowed');
	  return false;
    }
  }
}
```

We can modify this by setting a breakponit on responses in ZAP, and modifying the file before it gets to the browser. We‚Äôre going to change the `return false` statement on line 18 to `return true` so that the upload button is enabled irrespective of what file extension is used. 

![Screenshot 2023-09-03 at 12.26.19 PM.png](/assets/expose/Screenshot_2023-09-03_at_12.26.19_PM.png)

With this change in place we successfully upload our reverse shell. But to where? Given our history with this box we REALLY don‚Äôt want another round of directory brute-forcing. Thankfully, we are presented with a hint to remind us that there is a better way‚Ä¶.

![Screenshot 2023-09-03 at 12.33.58 PM.png](/assets/expose/Screenshot_2023-09-03_at_12.33.58_PM.png)

#### Extract PHP source to know path of uploads:

We‚Äôll go back to the `file1010111` page and extract `upload-cv00101011/index.php` through the LFI vulnerability. Because this is a PHP file and we want to retrieve it rather than execute it, we‚Äôll have to use encoding:

`POST http://10.10.xx.xx:1337/file1010111/index.php?file=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=../upload-cv00101011/index.php HTTP/1.1`

The above returns a base-64 string that decodes to the contents of `index.php`. 

```php
<?php
[...]
		
	$targetDir = "upload_thm_1001/"; // Directory where uploaded files will be stored
	$targetFile = $targetDir . basename($_FILES["file"]["name"]); // Path of the uploaded file

	// Check if file is a valid upload
	if (move_uploaded_file($_FILES["file"]["tmp_name"], $targetFile)) {
	    echo '<h1>File uploaded successfully! Maybe look in source code to see the path<span style=" display: none;">in /upload_thm_1001 folder</span> <h1>';
	} else {
	    echo "Error uploading file.";
	}

[...]
```
{: .nolineno }

Based on the code snippet above, our files can be found at `http://10.10.xx.xx:1337/upload-cv00101011/upload_thm_1001/`. We set up a listener on our box, browse to this directory, and click on our reverse shell file to trigger the shell.

### üèÅ Capture the User Flag

In our reverse-shell as www-data, we enumerate to find that z-------‚Äôs directory contains a file with their ssh credentials.

![Screenshot 2023-09-03 at 8.24.15 AM.png](/assets/expose/Screenshot_2023-09-03_at_8.24.15_AM.png)

We use these credentials to ssh back in as z------- and read the user flag from our new home directory.

### üèÅ¬†Capture the Root Flag

Enumerating again as z-------, we notice a couple of commands with elevated privileges.  

![Screenshot 2023-09-03 at 8.21.41 AM.png](/assets/expose/Screenshot_2023-09-03_at_8.21.41_AM.png)

Using the command `find /root/*` we can list out the files under /root. 

Using `nano /root/flag.txt` we can open the root flag in nano.
