Hello, 

I'm a longtime software engineer who enjoys CTFs as well as Amateur Radio and Formula 1 Racing.

I've been playing with HackTheBox and TryHackMe off and on form several years, and decided that creating write-ups would be a great way to force myself through all of the details and maximize how much I learn on any given box.

Most write-ups I've seen take you through the exact steps you need to solve a box. With mine I try to include my thinking as I progress through the box as well as some of the mistakes I make. I also like to include potentially valid paths that don't turn out to be the solution (rabbit holes).

I hope you enjoy what you read and maybe learn something new!
